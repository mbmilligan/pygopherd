!Welcome Campus Codefest 2016 to Pygopherd in OpenShift!

Unfortunately OpenShift is not able to route Gopher protocol traffic directly
so the page you are seeing is getting to you via HTTP. But this totally is
a Gopher server!

Some (gopher) links to get you started:

1Pygopherd Home	/devel/gopher/pygopherd	gopher.quux.org	70
1OverbiteFF gopher:// extention for Firefox	/overbite	gopher.floodgap.com	70
1Quux.Org Mega Server	/	gopher.quux.org	70
1The Gopher Project	/Software/Gopher	gopher.quux.org	70
1Traditional UMN Home Gopher (sadly defunct)	/	gopher.tc.umn.edu	70

Some web links:

hGet OverbiteFF extension from Mozilla	/URL:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/overbiteff/
hThis project on GitHub 	/URL:https://github.com/mbmilligan/pygopherd

PRs to add fun content (in the content/ folder) quite welcome!
